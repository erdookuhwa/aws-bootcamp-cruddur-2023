#### Testing RDS Connection
I began by creating a script that tests a connection to my `Postgres` database is successful. [`test-db-connection`]()

Next, to do a *__health check__* for my app, I added an endpoint to the flask app. [`app.py`]() and created a script for the [`health-check`]() which accesses the backend-flask server at the endpoint `api/health-check` and returns a success if `StatusCode = 200` or a failure if not.
